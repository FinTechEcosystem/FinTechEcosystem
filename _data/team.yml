  role: Research Assistant at the UCD College of Business
  bio: During my undergraduate degree in business engineering, I joined an integrated degree program with practical terms in a partner company after each semester. While appreciating the hands-on experience in the company, I realized that my major interest lies in the academic field, which is the reason for the decision to pursue a more scientific Master´s degree graduating highly distinguished (First-Class Honors) with a research-oriented MSc in Finance from UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. Various research projects at university and extracurricular activities such as the Global CFA Research Challenge 2017 confirmed my goal to become an academic. As a consequence of the decision to pursue a PhD, I decided to conduct further research until starting a PhD in fall 2018. I contribute to this project as a Research Assistant.
